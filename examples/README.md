# Examples
This directory contains example bugs found by Fuzzlyn. The `full` directory contains the full programs generated, which first uncovered the deviating behavior. The `reduced` directory contains programs which have been reduced but still have the deviating behavior found by the full program. For the most part, the `reduced` examples are the most interesting. Each file is named by its seed.
